The word Splat is there just because I wanted it to be there. But basically, SplatEncrypt is a file encryptor/decryptor and text encryptor/decryptor.\r\n\r\n## How do I get SplatEncrypt?\r\n### Click the link above, and download the EXE file. I don't see a Mac version of SplatEncrypt coming anytime soon, sorry Mac users.\r\n\r\n## Why are there so many files in this repository?\r\n### That, my noob, is called \"source code\". It's here because if someone wants to download it and make changes to their personal copy of SplatEncrypt, they can.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![SplatEncrypt](http://i.imgur.com/b1OoPD3.png)\r\n\r\n",
