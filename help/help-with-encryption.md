# Encryption Help

## How do I encrypt a file?
### Open the SplatEncrypt program. Tick the Encryption box, then click the Search button. Choose the file you want to encrypt. Then click the Save In button and choose where you want the encrypted file to be saved. In the Save In dialog, you need to give the encrypted file a name and you need to give it a file extension. Choose whichever extension you want. After choosing where to save, the encrypted file name, and extension, you can optionally put a password on the encrypted file. After entering (or not entering) a password, click the encrypt button with a lock icon. If you get an error [click here](https://github.com/MCMiners9/SplatEncrypt/issues) to report it. If you don't you should see the encrypted file show up wherever you chose to save it. And there you go, you've encrypted a file!

## Why am I getting an error?
### THe main reasons you are getting an error is one of the following: low storage space, an error in the code of the program (which is my fault), or an error with the file you are trying to encrypt.

## How can I ever thank you?
### Lol. :P
