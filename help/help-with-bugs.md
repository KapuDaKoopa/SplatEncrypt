# What to do if you find a bug in the program
## If you do find a bug in the program, please follow the steps below:
### Option 1: Report the Bug
#### To report a bug, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/MCMiners9/SplatEncrypt/issues) page and report it. If the issue is something that you believe could compromise someone's safety/identity, please privately [email MCMiners9](mailto:mcminers9@gmail.com) about it. Be sure to include your version number, the steps you took to cause the bug, and detailed information about it. And plus, theres a nice lil reward for anyone that reports a really huge/problematic bug! ;)

### Option 2: Don't Report the Bug
#### You can always choose not to report a bug and make someone else report it. Doing this will ruin the experience for everyone because if nobody report a bug, how will I know about it? So please report the bug

### Option 3: Tackle the bug yourself
#### This is only for the tech-savvy people, the people that know how to code in C#. Ok, here's what you need to do to get rid of the bug yourself. If you havent already, download the program. Open it in Visual Studio. Look for any issues in the code that may have caused the bug. Edit that code, revise it. Then, fork this repository. Delete/edit/add as many files as you needed to remove the bug. Then submit a pull request. Also, I recommend you make a branch after forking, this way I can always go back and see what you changed. If I approve your pull request, the bug is fixed!
