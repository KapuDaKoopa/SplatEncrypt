# Decryption Help

## Why do I get an error when I try to decrypt an encrypted file?
### This is a known bug. The decrypted file is going to be a blank. What I recommend you do is save a copy of the file BEFORE you encrypted it.

## How Do I Decrypt a File?
### To decrypt a file, you need to run SplatEncrypt. In SplatEncrypt, you need to check the Decryption box. Click search. Choose the file you want to decrypt. Click the save button. Choose where you want to save this file. If you placed a key on this file, enter it in the key box. Click Decrypt. You may get an error message. Ignore this, the file is decrypted. In some cases, the decrypted file may be blank. If so, then please make sure you have a backup of your encrypted file BEFORE you encrypted it.
