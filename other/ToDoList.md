# To Do List for SplatEncrypt

- [ ] Fix a bug that makes decrypting a file impossible.

- [ ] Redesign the GUI

- [ ] Make an auto updater that checks my `mcminers9.github.io` repository for a version.txt file, reads the version number, and if the version number on that repo is higher then the version number on the local copy of the tool, display a popup box asking users to update, if OK is selected, it automatically downloads SplatAIO.exe and replaces the old copy with the new one, then closes itself. It also checks my `mcminers9.github.io` repository for a changelog.txt then reads that and prints it on the dialog box.
